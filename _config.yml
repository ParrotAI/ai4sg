teamBlockTitle: "About AI4SG Bootcamp"
aboutUs: "Artificial intelligence(AI) and Machine learning(ML) are the most transformative technology with high potential to yield long-term benefits and help achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However Despite the potential of AI/ML, most developing countries including Tanzania face specific challenges in terms of skills, knowledge gaps and research capacity thus hampering any progress of utilizing the potential benefits.
To adress this challenge parrotai, has organized an  effective, time-efficient, and structured AI for Social Good(AI4SG) bootcamp.
The AI4SG Bootcamp is a training program for youth interested in learning how to apply AI in solving real-world problems. The goal for AI4SG is to train Tanzanian youth to become experts in AI and ML and create awareness on how to use these technologies for social goods. This, in turn, will lead to a motivated and knowledgeable generation of AI practitioners with a strong foundation and passion for solving community challenges."
teamsub_1BlockTitle: "What you'll learn"
learningGoal: "The Bootcamp is designed to help participants grasp both theoretical and practical foundations of AI  for social good with emphasis on how to ask the right question and formulate a learning problem.
 As part of theoretical and practical foundations, participants will learn quantitative critical thinking​ and key principles and techniques needed for  data-science and machine learning life-cycle. 
 These include the use of python programming for transforming, querying and analyzing data; implement  and use machine learning algorithms (regression, classification and clustering) for inference,  prediction and decision-making and principles behind creating informative data visualizations and exploratory data analysis. In addition, participants will be required to solve a particular Zindi challenge in order to apply the knowledge acquired."

teamsub_3BlockTitle: "Requirements and Prerequisites"
confRequirement: "No deep previous knowledge of AI is required, but the attendants are assumed to have at least some basic background on linear algebra, probabilities and basic programming skills. A review on basic concepts and an introduction to the necessary tools for implementation of lab work will be given in day one."

 - {title: "Android Wear", image: "hackathon-0.png", details: "The front doors will be locked because this is after hours, please park behind the building and come to the door nearest the parking lot.<br><br>Our last meeting showed that there was a lot of interest in Android Wear so we decided to put on an Android Wear Hackathon to see what you could come up with! We realize that this is pretty short notice so we hope you can help us spread the word! There will be pizza, prizes and a great group of geeks to spend the evening coding with! Even if you don't have an app idea come on in and lend a hand to someone else or maybe find inspiration once you're here!"}
 - {title: "Google Glass", image: "hackathon-1.png", details: "We love wearable computing especially Google Glass for which we want to gather the break up community in order to boost innovation.<br><br>Coding an app on Google Glass needs its Rockstar Dev : the team needs a fast learner with solid skills on Android. He knows his way around Android SDK, already checked the Glass Developement Kit (GDK) quick start guide allowing him to jump start developing an app for Glass.The Designer has the hard task to build the visual identity from the ground up, he has strong UX knowledge and a deep understanding of the new rules set by the Glass. His design skills give him the credibility to decide the most effective UI and the most compelling Glass experience."}
 - {title: "Polymer", image: "hackathon-2.png", details: "Polymer is a library that introduces web components. Web components are small elements on a page that can be extended and incorporated in web applications. The result is an increase in productivity.<br><br>We used Polymer mainly to explore the concept of web components. The transition of Google to material design was also a factor.While the library was never touched by the team, it still was painless to wireframe the application. Later on we incorporated some Polymer components in the design. We didn’t use the full potential of Polymer because of the limited time."}
